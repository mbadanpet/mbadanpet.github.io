Hi, I’m **Madhulika Badanpet**, a Sr. Client Systems Engineer focused on **Client Platform Engineering, Zero Trust Security, and data-driven compliance in enterprise IT**.  

Here, I write about technology, automation, and strategies for building secure, scalable, and efficient IT systems—exploring the intersection of automation, security, and data in modern IT, while covering the tools, frameworks, and practices that shape enterprise operations. This is also where I document real-world engineering work, research-inspired projects, and lessons learned from operating secure IT platforms at enterprise scale.
