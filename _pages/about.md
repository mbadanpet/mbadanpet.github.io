Here, I write about technology, automation, and strategies for building secure, scalable, and efficient IT systemsâ€”exploring the intersection of automation, security, and data in modern IT, while covering the tools, frameworks, and practices that shape enterprise operations. This is also where I document real-world engineering work, research-inspired projects, and lessons learned from operating secure IT platforms at enterprise scale.
